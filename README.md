WarwickAnalyticsDevTest
This is a development test I was preparing for Warwick Analytics. It is incomplete because I received notice while working on it that they were no longer able to hire for the role I applied for.

This was a full stack assessment using your chosen technologies to develop a server and front-end. The task was to make an application which counted a specific words occurence in a set of words.

The solution was containerized to run as a single application with ASP.NET Core serving content and providing the API endpoint with React as the front-end.
